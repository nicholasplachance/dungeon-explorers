# Dungeon Explorers

Dungeon Explorers is an experimental game/application that leverages interactive narrative mechanics (potentially AI-driven) to guide players through a series of dungeon crawls. The project aims to be a creative playground for building storytelling experiences, puzzle solving, or even board-game-like combat encounters.

## Introduction

Dungeon Explorers was started to explore how collaborative storytelling or turn-based game mechanics could be combined with modern web development (and potentially AI integration) to create a fun, immersive experience for players or game masters. The project is still in early stages and is actively seeking feedback, contributions, and new ideas.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Navigate dungeons, encounter creatures, gather loot, and progress your character’s story.
- **Narrative Engine**: A lightweight framework for handling branching dialogue, scenario outcomes, or puzzle logic.
- **(Planned) Multiplayer / Co-op**: The ability to have multiple players exploring the same dungeon simultaneously, or to have a GM orchestrate the story.
- **(Planned) AI-Assistance**: Integrations with GPT-based or other AI services to dynamically generate storylines or respond to user actions in an emergent, narrative-focused way.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: (e.g., Node.js / Express, or another framework of your choice)
- **Frontend**: (e.g., React, Vue, or plain JavaScript)
- **Database**: (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or in-memory)
- **Languages**: JavaScript/TypeScript (or whatever is actually used in your repository)
- **Other**:
  - Testing: (e.g., Jest, Mocha, or Cypress)
  - Linting & Formatting: (e.g., ESLint, Prettier)

## Roadmap / TODO

- [ ] **Basic Game Loop**  
  - Finalize the logic for exploring rooms, encountering enemies, and collecting loot.
  
- [ ] **UI Enhancements**  
  - Create interactive character sheets and real-time status updates.
  
- [ ] **Story / Scenario Builder**  
  - Implement a friendly UI for adding new quests, story arcs, or custom events.
  
- [ ] **Combat Mechanics**  
  - Implement turn-based combat or real-time encounters.
  - Add advanced dice-rolling logic, special abilities, and modifiers.
  
- [ ] **Multiplayer/Co-op**  
  - Set up sockets (e.g., Socket.IO) or a real-time backend to allow multiple players to join the same session.
  
- [ ] **AI Integration**  
  - Experiment with GPT-based integrations (or other LLMs) for dynamic enemy generation, lore expansions, or in-game NPC dialogue.
  
- [ ] **Database Integration**  
  - Persist user progress, items, and quest states in a production-ready database.
  
- [ ] **Testing & QA**  
  - Write unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests to ensure reliability.
  
- [ ] **Deployment**  
  - Create a pipeline for hosting on a cloud platform (AWS, Heroku, Vercel, etc.).
  
- [ ] **Documentation**  
  - Expand the README, write in-app tutorials, or create a wiki for advanced usage.
